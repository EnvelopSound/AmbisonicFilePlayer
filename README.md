Ambisonic File Player
+
 +The Ambisonic File Player is meant for pre-encoded ambisonic b-format, 1st order 4 channel interleaved files. There are 3 player duplicated for mixing. The file player includes an AMBIX plugin for converting the channel ordering and scaling convention to match that of the decoder being used. The HOA decoder in the Envelop for Live max project uses ACN/SN3D. (Often b-format mic recording are encoded with the FUMA channel ordering and scaling) 
 +
 +To use the Ambisonic File Player within the E4L project, connect the output 1-4 to the decoder input 1-4. Alternatively another decoder object may be inserted in addition to the E4L decoder and routed directly to dac object.
